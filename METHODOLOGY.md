## Understanding COBOL
1. Used Claude Code to explain code and functionalities.
2. Mapped out data structures and flow
3. Identified all edge cases

## Defining "Correct Migration"
A correct migration means:
- All user-facing behaviors are identical
- Edge cases handled the same way
- Same error messages
- Same limits (100 users, 50 sessions)

## Testing Strategy
- Created behavior_tests.py with 12 unit tests using Python's unittest framework
- Black box testing approach - tests validate behavior without knowing implementation details
- Tests directly manipulate system's data structures to simulate operations
- Each test uses setUp() to create fresh system instance for isolation
- Tests verify expected outcomes using assertions (assertEqual, assertTrue, etc.)
- Covers happy paths, error conditions, and boundary conditions
- run_evaluation.py executes all tests with verbose output and displays summary

## Grading System
- evaluate_refactor.py provides comprehensive grading (100 points total)
- **Behavior Tests (60 points)**: Validates that refactored code behaves identically to legacy COBOL
- **Code Quality (20 points)**: Measures proper class structure, required methods, and data initialization
- **Legacy Compatibility (20 points)**: Ensures fixed array sizes, token range, and data structure fields match COBOL exactly
- Grade scale: A (90+), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (<60)
- Pass threshold: 70 points minimum
